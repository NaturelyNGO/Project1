# This is web development project for internship under Ansrcoach.
Basically this is a NGO website with hypothetical content and ideas. it is designed using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Bootstrap framework, MYSQL databse to store data from contact and donation form. And for donation acceptance i have used razorpay payment integration(Test Mode).
For sucessful running of this project you need to have php server, xampp server sucessfully installed on your machine. And should have signed in on razorpay platform to perform transitions.
MySQL is connected to form via PHP. So mysql database name - data_base
Table name for contact form - contact_info,
Table name for donation form - donate_info.
